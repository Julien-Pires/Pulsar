## 0.2.6 (April 25, 2013)

- **Graphics:**
  - Graph namespace have been renamed to SceneGraph
  - SceneGraph class has been renamed to SceneTree
  - GeometryBatch class has been renamed to InstanceBatch
  - GeometryBatchManager class has been renamed to InstanceBatchManager
  - Finding a specific instance of InstanceBatch has been improved
  - InstanceBatch and InstanceBatchManager have been moved to Graphics.Rendering namespace
  - Processing instanced entity occurred now during the rendering stage and not at the queue processing as before
  - RenderingInfo constructor is now internal
  - Added a function to find a SubEntity instance in an entity
  - ID for IRenderable instance are now generated by RenderingInfo instance. This ensures integrity in the generation of ID
  - MeshBoundingBox reuse existing vertices instead of recreated them. Only the Position field is updated
- **Assets**
  - RenderingInfo of a SubMesh can be modified using SetRenderingInfo method
  - Added a function to find a SubMesh instance in a mesh
  - Material can be modified on SubMesh
  - SubMesh instance in a mesh can have an unique name
  - SubMesh can now be removed of mesh
  - Mesh and SubMesh class are now in separated file
- **Component:**
  - ComponentHandler can be associated to one or more component type. With this mecanism ComponentHandler are only notified for concerned component
  - Owner property of ComponentHandler can only be modified by ComponentHandlerSystem class
- **Miscellaneous:**
  - Demo project is now separated from Pulsar library and is located in demo folder with its own VS solution
  - Source code has been commented

## 0.2.5 (April 9, 2013)

Bugfix release

- **New:**
  - Added Xbox 360 version of Pulsar
- **Graphics:**
  - Added a virtual remove function on the Node class to implement specific remove task for specific node implementation
  - Root class doesn't longer need a ContentManager instance in his constructor
  - Remove BaseEffect class (use Shader class instead)
  - IsVisible property was replaced by IsRendered in IMovable interface to avoid misunderstanding with Visible property
  - Added a new class BoundingVolume to manage bounding shapes and their updates
  - Fixed a bug in which AABB doesn't fit meshes entirely
  - MeshBoundingBox is now displayed with full line
- **Asset:**
  - Added a function to add submesh in a mesh
  - Mesh informations are now updated when a submesh is added
  - Add a vertex buffer and an index buffer when an empty mesh is created by MeshManager. Manual mesh should use those buffers for submeshes.
  - Moved CreateMaterial function from MeshManager to MaterialManager
  - Added parameters to create more personnalized checkerboard texture in CreateMissingTexture functions
  - Removed IsSolid property in Material class. Now to determine if a material is solid or transparent use IsTransparent property
- **Component:**
  - Removed owner parameter of type GameObjectManager in the constructor of GameObject class
  - Fixed a bug in which a game object with components added to a GameObjectManager doesn't notify component handler of the existing components
- **Miscellaneous:**
  - Removed out modifiers
  - Removed default parameters
